# Exercise: auth

In this exercise you will utilize React Context to share global state among many components and add routing to navigate between different views in your application.

## Part 1 - Routing

The application has a link to navigate to a page component ("view") - `pages/Users` - to display a list of users.

1. Set up a route to navigate to the `/users` route. Follow the example of the `/login` route.

2. If the user tries to navigate to a route that does not exist, it's important to catch it and inform the user.

   Add a catch-all route; see the [documentation](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial#adding-a-no-match-route) for more information. Use the `components/NotFound` component.

   Try a path such as _http://localhost:3000/foo_ to verify that the catch-all route works.

## Part 2 - Context

As part of the application requirements, the /users route must be protected, i.e. an user must be logged in to see the list of users.

The state of a logged in user must be shared among several components in the component tree, including:

- The `components/RouteGuard` component, which determines whether or not a route should be rendered based on authentication status.

- The `pages/Login` view, which enables a user to log in.

- The `components/Navigation` component, which renders a logout button only if the user is logged in.

As such, authentication state is best placed in a context that the application is rendered with.

> Refer to the `dependencyContext` example for guidance when implementing the steps below.

1. Create an `AppProvider.tsx` file:

- Create an `AppContext` inside.

- This code below is the logic the `AppProvider` should contain.

  ```typescript
  const [user, setUser] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [loginError, setLoginError] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const login = async (credential: string): Promise<void> => {
    if (credential === "admin") {
      setUser(credential);
      setLoginError(false);
    } else {
      setLoginError(true);
    }
  };

  const logout = (): void => {
    setUser(null);
  };

  // Render AppContext.Provider with these two state variables and methods as the context value. Don't forget to type everything up.
  ```

- Return the context from the `useAppContext` helper hook, which you can figure out if you look at the `dependencyContext` example. The hook can be places inside the `AppProvider`.

2. Render the AppProvider component as the top-level component in _index.tsx_.

To verify that the application context is working, do the following:

3. Wrap the Users component with the `RouteGuard` component in the `element`-prop of the Route that handles the path "users".

4. Do the `TODOS` in the `RouteGuard` component.

5. Navigate to the `/users` route; it should redirect to the Login view.

## Part 2 - Redux

(For context instructions, look farther down)

As part of the application requirements, the /users route must be protected, i.e. an user must be logged in to see the list of users.

The state of a logged in user must be shared among several components in the component tree, including:

- The `components/RouteGuard` component, which determines whether or not a route should be rendered based on authentication status.

- The `pages/Login` view, which enables a user to log in.

- The `components/Navigation` component, which renders a logout button only if the user is logged in.

As such, authentication state is best placed in a redux state manager that can be used throughout the application.

> Refer to the `dependencyRedux` example for guidance when implementing the steps below.

1. Create a `store.ts` file. This is the content it should have:

```typescript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // TODO: Implement the slice/slices you need.
  },
});

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;

/**
 * These hooks is just an implementation of the already existing hooks in
 * redux, we have just given them the correct typing.
 */
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

2. Create the `authSlice.ts` file. In here you need a couple of imports but you also need to define the state for the slice. This should be an interface called _IAuthState_ and it should contain a _user_ and a _loginError_.

3. Create the slice and it should contain two reducer functions. One for _login_ and one for _logout_, they should interact with the state (both _user_ and _loginError_) in a proper way. You can decide yourself how you implement the login functionality in your application. In the example solution, if the user types in "admin" in the input field, they get logged in. The "admin"-string is than set as the value of the IAuthState user. See the context section for some hints.
   Don't forget to make to proper exports at the bottom of the file.

4. In the `index.tsx` file you need to wrap your JSX in a **Provider** element. This element is what gives all the nested elements access to the global state. The **Provider** accepts an attribute **store** which should have the value of the exported variable from the **store.ts** file.

5. To try out that your redux store works, do the TODOS in the `RouteGuard` component. Wrap the Users component with the `RouteGuard` component in the element-prop of the Route that handles the path "users". Navigate to the /users route; it should redirect to the Login view.

## Part 3 - Authentication

The `pages/Login` component renders a view for authenticating a user, using the global state available via the application context.

Implement the comments marked with _TODO_.

> Note that authentication state is not saved between sessions; simply reload the page to reset the state.

### Logout

To allow the user to logout, implement the comments marked with _TODO_ in the `components/Navigation` component.

## Optional 1

### (This exercise is not specific to context or redux)

Now the _Users_ component renders a _User_ whenever we click on a name in the users-list. A different approach can be made here. _User_ is already its own component, the thing we could do is to give it its own route aswell, much like _Login_ and _Users_ already have.

The challenge here is to render the same _User_ component but with different props depending on the name we click on. We need a couple of things in order to achieve this:

1. First we need to lift up the state of the _Users_ component (_i.e. the users-list_) to the context in order for _User_ component to access it. Make sure that the context also shares that state with the rest of the application.

2. Secondly, create a new route for the _User_ component. Check out the [documentation on reading url params](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview#reading-url-parameters) for route parameters (_URL-parameters_), and how to access those parameters from within the components.

3. Thirdly, when everything is set up it's time for the _User_ component to make sure that it displays the correct data depending on which name we clicked on in the _Users_ component.

   > `Hint`: it involves using the **array.find()** method and the **useParams()** hook.

4. Finally, add a back button so it's easy to get back to the _Users_ list.

## Optional 2

### Context

The logic for fetching users is now written in the `Users` component with all the state and fetch functions.

- Create a `UserProvider` context and extract this logic to that provider. Don't forget to wrap your `App` components with this provider.

- Add fetching statuses that the application can react to. Maybe show some feedback the fetch is loading or went wrong.

### Redux

The logic for fetching users is now written in the `Users` component with all the state and fetch functions. Try to extract this logic to an `UsersSlice` and also add fetching statuses that the application can react to. Maybe show some feedback the fetch is loading or went wrong.

Reducers as we have used them now, can only handle synchronous logic, but fetching is something asynchronous. For that we need something called `createAsyncThunk` which is a function that is included in redux toolkit. Here is the link to the [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk). This optional is a challenge but it's worth it. You can also check the solution [repository](https://github.com/Aarkan1/react-ts-foundation-final) for an example of this.

## Optional 3 - No solution exists

### Loading Data with 3rd Party Library

If you try to navigate to the `/users` route and then _quickly_ navigate back to home, you'll notice the following error in the console:

`Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.`

This happens because the code in useEffect, once data has been fetched, tries to update state, even though the component has already been unmounted (which occurred when you quickly navigated back to home).

This problem can be solved in a couple of ways ([here](https://www.debuggr.io/react-update-unmounted-component/) is one solution) but along with using the useState and useEffect hooks, it all gets a bit cumbersome. Notice also that the users data is not cached but loaded every time you navigate to the Users view.

For these and other reasons, it's recommended to use a robust 3rd party library for efficient data fetching. There are several libraries available, such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

For our purposes, **react-query** is an excellent choice: follow the [documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview) and refactor the data fetching code in the Users page component accordingly.
