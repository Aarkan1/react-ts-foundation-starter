   * and an action payload (The action payload can be optional depending on the reducers
   * function). When an actions is dispatched the slice goes through its reducers to see
   * which reducer that matches the incoming action.
   *
   * Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It doesn't
   * actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library underneath, which detects
   * changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new immutable state based
   * off those changes
   *
   * The type "PayloadAction" is a generic type that redux gives us so that we can type up
   * our action in a correct way.
