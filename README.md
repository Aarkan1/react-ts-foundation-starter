This document describes the examples that were coded during the Edument React Typescript Foundation course.

# Requirements

Ensure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.

The editor used during the course is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Also install [React Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi).

# Usage

In the project directory, run:

    npm install

to install the project's dependencies.

## Available Scripts

    npm start

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

    npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles and optimizes React for production mode.

# Examples

The code for each example is located in a separate folder under `src`.

A code example can be run by uncommenting the corresponding "App"/component it in `src/index.ts`. This renders the _App_ component for that example.

## feed

This example demonstrates the fundamentals of coding React components, including JSX syntax and rendering lists.

## todo

This example demonstrates component styling, event handling, hooks and parent / child component communication.

- Common hooks:

  - _useState_
  - _useEffect_

- Styling via:

  - Styled components with the **styled-components** library (see `Todo.tsx`).
  - Inline styling (see `TodoForm.tsx`).

## useEffect

The `useEffect` folder contains microexamples that highlight certain aspects of using the _useEffect_ hook. See each file in the folder for comments.

> Choose which microexample to run by uncommenting it in `useEffect/index.js`.

## dependencyContext

A demo of rendering a component tree in a React Context, enabling global state to be shared among many components.

Also, a context may be used for **dependency injection** of "services", such as a log service that can be properly configured depending on the runtime environment (development vs production).

## auth

The general structure of this example is as follows:

- "Users" data is fetched from a REST API.

- The _React Router_ library is used to implement routes and navigation.

  The available routes are:

  - `/`

    Displays a welcome message.

  - `/users`

    Displays links to all users.

  - `/users:id` - _optional exercise_

    Displays data about a single user (with the user id indicated by the _route parameter_ `id`).

  - A non-existent route, such as `/foo`, will be caught by a _default_ route.

- Each of the routes above corresponds to a component being rendered, which may be considered a "page".
  These page components are located in the `pages` folder.

- The `/users` route required the user to be logged in.

  User authentication logic is written in a context provider.

  The component tree is rendered in a React Context called _AppContext_ (see `AppProvider.tsx`). This context invokes the _useAuth_ hook to get and subsequently manage global authentication state and related functionality (login and logout).

  The components that access the _AppContext_ to retrieve global authentication state and functionality are:

  - The page component _Login_, enabling a user to log in.

  - The _RouteGuard_ component, guarding (preventing navigation to) the `/users` route.

  - The _Navigation_ component, allowing the logged in user to log out.

> Install the [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) to inspect a Redux store and its state at runtime.
